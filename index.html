	   			<p class="lead animate-this"> Studio Ghibli is a Japanese studio responsible for some of the finest feature-length animation films ever produced, inspiring countless artists and filmmakers including John Lasseter who once said that Ghibli founder “Hayao Miyazaki is the greatest animation director living today.” High praise indeed.</p>

   				<h3>Start Here</h3>
   			   <h1>Spirited Away</h1>
   			
   			   <p class="lead">Widely regarded as Miyazaki’s masterpiece, Spirited Away is an incredible achievement in animated cinema. A coming-of-age story with hints of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland and The Wizard of Oz thrown in with the trademark of Ghibli whimsy, wisdom and imagination. It tells the story of Chihiro, a young girl moving house with her parents. They get lost and stumble upon what they believe to be an abandoned theme park that turns out to be a realm where the spirits dwell.</p>

	            	<h3> The Story</h3>

		            <p class="lead">With her parents cursed and Chihiro trapped in this mysterious place, she has no choice but to take a job at a mysterious bathhouse where the clientele is predominantly made up of wandering benevolent spirits and humans are persona non grata.<br> <br> For over two hours we watch a young girl grapple with the responsibilities of maturing in a world that operates secretly within her own – the animation is incredible, the vast array of characters simply awe-inspiring, and each thread of the story builds to something much larger than the sum of its parts.

   				<h3>Watch This Next</h3>
   			   <h1>My Neighbor Totoro</h1>
   			
   			   <p class="lead">One of the earliest Ghibli films, and featuring a titular character that would go on to be the company’s mascot, My Neighbor Totoro is a thematically similar film to Spirited Away, but with an entirely different outlook. Like its distant cousin Spirited Away, it focuses on young girls (this time sisters Mei and Satsuki) moving to a new home and discovering a secret world within it. This time though, there’s no supernatural curse or fantastical prison-like work conditions.</p>

	            <div class="section-intro">
	            	<h3 class="h05">The Story</h3>

		            <p>The film explores the two young girls and their father as they adjust to life in the countryside. Their mother is seriously ill in a nearby hospital and the sweet, subtle movements of the film’s narrative are a celebration of the imagination of children, as well as a supportive father. Where Spirited Away curses parents’ greed, My Neighbor Totoro rewards the perseverance of a close-knit family. Oh, there’s also a group of adorable monsters named Totoro who help the girls to cope and familiarize themselves with the incredible enchanted environment that surrounds their new home.</p>

   				<h3>Another Classic</h3>
   			   <h1>Howl's Moving Castle</h1>
   			
   			   <p class="lead">A love story between an 18-year-old girl named Sophie, cursed by a witch into an old woman's body, and a magician named Howl. Under the curse, Sophie sets out to seek her fortune, which takes her to Howl's strange moving castle. In the castle, Sophie meets Howl's fire demon, named Karishifâ. Seeing that she is under a curse, the demon makes a deal with Sophie--if she breaks the contract he is under with Howl, then Karushifâ will lift the curse that Sophie is under, and she will return to her 18-year-old shape.</p>

	            	<h3 class="h05">The Story</h3>

		            <p>One of the central ideas in fairy tales is metamorphosis: handsome princes secreted away in the body of frogs, geese who transmute eggs into gold. Howl’s Moving Castle has enough metamorphoses to make Ovid’s head spin — most of the major characters are under some kind of form-shifting spell. The trope of the prince imprisoned in another body occurs here, but many of the characters’ transformations are more mysterious and psychological.</p>

	   			<p class="lead animate-this"> From here you have several worlds at your fingertips, each one as intricate and varied as the last. You can really go anywhere within Studio Ghibli’s vast repertoire after this, but here’s a couple more recommendations just to pique your interest. </p>

                        <p class="specialheading2">Princess Mononoke<br /></p>
								<p>A harrowing epic of war and environmentalism. Deeply spiritual and steeped in mythology, but with an ultimately human message of preservation and conservation. Mononoke was given a theatrical release in the West at its full duration of 2-hours, 14-minutes.</p>
							</div>

                        <p class="specialheading2">Kiki's Delivery Service</p>
				        <p>A tale of growing up and wrestling with the transition between modern and traditional cultures, told through the eyes of a young girl going out in the world for the first time. The recurring motif of flying really establishes itself in this film, as does Miyazaki’s trademark sense of childlike wonder.</p>

                    <div class="content">
				    <p class="specialheading2">Grave of the Fireflies</p>
								<p>This is an incredibly moving piece of work that deserves its place as one of Ghibli’s finest works, but it is devastating. Set towards the end of the Second World War, it follows the story of a brother and sister whose mother was killed and home destroyed in a raid.</p>
